    "We have seen that Quantum states are expressed as vectors of complex coefficients. The size of this vector grows exponentially with the number of particles $N$ as $2^N$ complex numbers. This means that storing a Quantum state of $N \\sim 50$ may require PB of memory. \n",
    "\n",
    "Luckily, there is another way of writing Quantum states based on a matrix description. We assume that a Quantum state of N particles can be expressed in a basis of elements $|i_1 ... i_N\\rangle$, where $i_k=[0,1]$ is an index. The basis has components for any combination of values on the indices. \n",

    "The value of the matrices may change for each position. The parameter $D$ is an additional parameter that is adjusted to have an efficient representation: instead of using $2^N$ coefficients we have now $2\\times D^2\\times N$. The price we pay is that a representation of a Quantum state in MPS form may not be exact, only an approximation to the original state. \n",

To perform this operation, we only need to use the matrices $M_0$ and $M_1$ at position $k$, and apply the 1-qubit gate. Afterwards, we recover the MPS form with local operations. For 2-qubit gates things can be slightly more complex, but alo may be perform locally.\n",
